I have a deep interest in web development and Programming in general. I have completed three projects using React js and Node js. Science 2019, I tried multiple things such as Graphics Design, Video Editing, WordPress Development, etc. But I couldn't find my passion until I tried Web Development. After learning some basic HTML, CSS, and JS, I feel like I'm falling in love with programming. In this journey, I realized that I was not improving rapidly, so I enrolled in Programming Hero's Complete Web Development course. Now I am constantly learning new things and evolving every day.`;
